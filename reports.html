						<h3>Wide spread vulnerability in Citrix Gateway and Citrix Application Delivery Controller</h3>
						<p>13 January 2020, by Frank Breedijk</br></br>
						The problem</br>
On December 17th Citrix <a href="https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027" target="_blank">published</a> a vulnerability in Citrix Application Delivery Controller (ADC) products. These products are also known as NetScaler ADC, Citrix Gateway en Netscaler Gateway. Exploitation of the vulnerability allows an attack to execute arbirary commandâ€™s on these servers. Early January it became clear that attackers were actively probing for vulnerable servers. On the 11th of January various sources, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/projectzeroindia/CVE-2019-19781" target="_blank">Project Zero Day India</a> and <a href="https://github.com/trustedsec/cve-2019-19781" target="_blank">Trusted Sec</a> published exploitation code that demonstrated that exploiting the vulnerabiulity is trivial.</br>
<br/>
What to do?<br/>
	Citrix has announced that <a href="https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267027" target="_blank">patches</a> will be vailable soon (from January 20th onwards). We advise you to install these patches a.s.a.p. Until that time the vulnerability can be <a href="https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX267679" target="_blank">mitigated</a> via the configuration. We advise you to apply this mitigation now! Please note that a valid license is required to implement this mitigation. Please take note that it is poissible that devices that did not have patches or mitigations applied may already have been taken over by an attacker.<br/>
<br/>
What we are doing.<br/>
As of this morning around 11:00 we were aware of 546 publicly accessible vulnerable devices in The Netherlands. We are currently actively informing the network owners of the networks containing vulnerable devices.<br/>
