						<h2>our mission</h2>
						<p>We aim to make the digital world safer by reporting vulnerabilities we find in digital systems to the people who can fix them. We have a global reach, but do it Dutch style: open, honest, collaborative and for free.</p>

									<h3>OUR TEAM</h3>

								<p>DIVD is a platform for security researchers to report vulnerabilities, supported by volunteers.</p>

									<h3>TO DO: REPORTS</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Here you will find a timeline with our vulnerability reports. We only publish after vulnerabilities are fixed and negotiate with the stakeholders involved to which extent they are mentioned.</p>

									<h3>TO DO: TICKETING SYSTEM</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Vulnerabilities found by our researchers, are registered in our ticketing system, where other researcher do a triage on their proof of concept. This allows us to follow progress on each case and do meta analyses on our portfolio of cases. </p>

									<h3>TO DO: STATS</h3>
								</header>
								<p>Some vulnerabilities come in big numbers. It’s impossible to track all their owners to report to them, but providing stats may stimulate vendors, resellers and the general public to take security more seriously, run updates, adjust configuration or take crappy devices offline.</p>

									<h3>CONTACT</h3>
								</header>
								<p>We are in the phase of starting up, so don’t send us vulnerability reports yet. We already have more than enough in our own backlog. If you want to become one of our researchers, or help out in any other way, you are more than welcome and send your mail to the address “board”. Any other questions can be sent to “question”.</p>

						<h2>our code of conduct</h2>
						<p>If you find vulnerabilities, you find out who owns the system, report to them first, with a clear prove of concept and your contact information. You don't: damage the system, download personal data or build backdoors. We believe social engineering, brute forcing and DDoS attacks are out of scope.</p>
<p>If you are responsible for a digital system, you should have a pont of contact where researchers can file their report, promise to respond within three working days, update on the progress, warn others who might be affected, refrain from legal action and credit the researcher if the findings prove valuable.						<section>
